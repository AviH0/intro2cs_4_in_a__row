# Into2CS - Four In A Row

This is the project I submitted as the final exercise in mh intro to cs course at HUJI.
I decided to implement the game with 3D graphics running over the 2D grapchis framework of TKinter Cnavas.
The 3D models were taken from public domain or created using Microsoft Paint3D, and then parsed manually from .obj files.
