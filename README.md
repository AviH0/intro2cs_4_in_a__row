# Into2CS - Four In A Row

## Gerneral Description
This is the project I submitted together with my partner as the final exercise in my intro to cs course at HUJI.
I decided to implement the game with 3D graphics running over the 2D grapchis framework of TKinter Cnavas.
The 3D models were taken from public domain or created using Microsoft Paint3D, and then parsed manually from .obj files.

## How To Run
Simply clone the project or download as zip file, and run four_in_a_row.py with python 3. Requires numpy.
